## Welcome to my personal website

This website will be used to host my portfolio, bio information, and contact information. In later iterations, it will have a functional contact form for potential employers or clientele. 

## Most recent additions

This is the first build of the website. It has been made to be responsive, the bio has been completed, placeholder portfolio images have been created, and the structure for a contact form has been completed.
